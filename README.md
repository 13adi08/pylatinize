## Features

- **Transliteration**: Convert Unicode text to Latin ASCII.
- **Normalization**: Supports various Unicode normalization forms.
- **Configurable Mappings**: Customize the way characters are transliterated.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for easy integration into your projects.
- **Open Source**: Freely available for use and modification.

## Installation

To install **pylatinize**, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pylatinize
```

You can also download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/13adi08/pylatinize/releases) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Usage

Using **pylatinize** is straightforward. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
from pylatinize import Latinizer

text = "Caf√© na√Øve r√©sum√©"
latinized_text = Latinizer().transliterate(text)
print(latinized_text)  # Output: Cafe naive resume
```

In this example, the library automatically removes diacritics and converts accented characters to their ASCII equivalents.

## Configuration

You can customize the transliteration process by providing your own mappings. Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

```python
from pylatinize import Latinizer

custom_mappings = {
    '√©': 'e',
    '√±': 'n',
    '√ß': 'c',
}

latinizer = Latinizer(mappings=custom_mappings)
text = "Caf√© na√Øve r√©sum√©"
latinized_text = latinizer.transliterate(text)
print(latinized_text)  # Output: Cafe naive resume
```

This feature allows you to tailor the library to meet your specific needs.

## Examples

Here are some more examples to illustrate the capabilities of **pylatinize**:

### Example 1: Basic Transliteration

```python
text = "Jalape√±o"
latinized_text = Latinizer().transliterate(text)
print(latinized_text)  # Output: Jalapeno
```

### Example 2: Handling Emojis

```python
text = "I love üçï and ‚òï!"
latinized_text = Latinizer().transliterate(text)
print(latinized_text)  # Output: I love  and !
```

### Example 3: Custom Mappings

```python
custom_mappings = {
    '√º': 'u',
    '√∂': 'o',
}

latinizer = Latinizer(mappings=custom_mappings)
text = "F√ºnf √ºber alles"
latinized_text = latinizer.transliterate(text)
print(latinized_text)  # Output: Funf uber alles
```
